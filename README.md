ðŸš€ How to Access Your Virtual Machine Like a Pro
Step 1: What You Need
Before diving in, make sure you have:
âœ… Your .pem key file (in this case, gatitu.pem)
âœ… Your VM's public IP address (20.246.98.159)
âœ… A terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Linux/Mac Terminal)

Step 2: Move to the Right Folder
Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where gatitu.pem is stored. If itâ€™s in Downloads, type:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/Downloads
For Windows users with PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads
Step 3: Set Permissions for the Key File
To keep things secure, change the file permissions for gatitu.pem:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod 400 gatitu.pem
(Skip this step on Windows; itâ€™s more of a Linux/Mac thing.)

Step 4: Connect to Your Virtual Machine
Now, letâ€™s jump in! Run this command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i gatitu.pem gatitu@20.246.98.159
ðŸš€ BOOM! Youâ€™re in! ðŸš€

Troubleshooting Tips ðŸ› 
Permission Denied Error? Check that the key file has the correct permissions (chmod 400 helps).
Connection Timed Out? Ensure your VM is running and your firewall/security group allows SSH (port 22).
Wrong Path to Key File? Double-check youâ€™re in the correct directory before running the SSH command.
Whatâ€™s Next?
Now that youâ€™re in your VM, you can:
âœ… Install software
âœ… Deploy applications
âœ… Host websites
âœ… Run scripts
